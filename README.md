Requires modules pygame and numpy. If they are not installed, the program will install them on your system with `os.system()`.  

`config.py` contains the constants needed to run `main.py`. To change any settings of Virutal Cube, you can edit `config.py`'s settings to your desire.

## Instructions
<ul>
  <li>Click and drag with your mouse/touchpad/touchscreen to rotate/look around the cube</li>
  <li>Use the F, B, L, R, U, and D keys to move</li>
  <li>F = Front, B = Back, L = Left, R = Right, U = Up, D = Down</li>
  <li>Each move is clockwise when looking directly at the face you are turning</li>
  <li>To execute a prime move (counterclockwise move), hold shift while moving a face</li>
</ul>
